  "text": "Emotional loneliness comes from not having enough emotional\\nintimacy with other people. It can start in childhood, due to\\nfeeling emotionally unseen by self-preoccupied parents, or it can\\narise in adulthood when an emotional connection is lost. If it\u2019s been a\\nlifelong feeling, it points to the likelihood of not being sufficiently emotionally responded to as a child.\\nGrowing up in a family with emotionally immature parents is a lonely\\nexperience. These parents may look and act perfectly normal, caring for\\ntheir child\u2019s physical health and providing meals and safety. However, if\\nthey don\u2019t make a solid emotional connection with their child, the child\\nwill have a gaping hole where true security might have been.\\nThe loneliness of feeling unseen by others is as fundamental a pain as\\nphysical injury, but it doesn\u2019t show on the outside. Emotional loneliness is\\na vague and private experience, not easy to see or describe. You might call\\nit a feeling of emptiness or being alone in the world. Some people have\\ncalled this feeling existential loneliness, but there\u2019s nothing existential\\nabout it. If you feel it, it came from your family.\\nChildren have no way of identifying a lack of emotional intimacy in\\ntheir relationship with a parent. It isn\u2019t a concept they have. And it\u2019s even \\nless likely that they can understand that their parents are emotionally\\nimmature. All they have is a gut feeling of emptiness, which is how a child\\nexperiences loneliness. With a mature parent, the child\u2019s remedy for loneliness is simply to go to the parent for affectionate connection. But if your\\nparent was scared of deep feelings, you might have been left with an uneasy\\nsense of shame for needing comforting.\\nWhen the children of emotionally immature parents grow up, the\\ncore emptiness remains, even if they have a superficially normal adult life.\\nTheir loneliness can continue into adulthood if they unwittingly choose\\nrelationships that can\u2019t give them enough emotional connection. They\\nmay go to school, work, marry, and raise children, but all the while they\u2019ll\\nstill be haunted by that core sense of emotional isolation. In this chapter,\\nwe\u2019ll look at people\u2019s experience of emotional loneliness, along with how\\nself-awareness helped them understand what they were missing and how\\nto change.",
